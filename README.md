以下是一些关于这篇论文的问题及可能的解答：
 
1. 问题：在计算典型性分数时，为何将 t 的采样范围限制在 [0.1, 0.7] 能提高结果质量？
- 解答：文中指出，如在补充材料所示，减少 t 的采样范围到 [0.1, 0.7] 是因为原始范围的两端可能会贡献无信息但典型的样本，缩小范围有助于排除这些干扰，从而使典型性分数更能准确反映视觉元素与类别的相关性，提高结果质量。
2. 问题：使用 k - means 聚类时，如何解决出现混合集群或重复相似集群的问题？
- 解答：论文未提及具体解决方法，但可以考虑探索其他聚类算法，如基于密度的 DBSCAN 算法，它能够识别不同密度区域，可能更适合处理复杂的数据分布，减少混合集群情况；或者在特征提取阶段进一步优化，尝试使用更具判别力的特征，避免因特征相似导致的重复集群问题。
3. 问题：对于不同类型的数据集（如汽车、人脸、地理、场景），在应用该方法时是否需要特定的参数调整？
- 解答：文中未详细说明针对不同数据集的特定参数调整。但从实验过程来看，在微调阶段可能需要根据数据集的特点调整训练的轮数、学习率等参数。例如，对于复杂的场景数据集，可能需要更多的训练轮数以学习到足够的特征表示；对于特征相对简单的汽车数据集，可能可以适当降低学习率防止过拟合。同时，在计算典型性和聚类时，也可能需要根据数据的尺度、特征分布等调整相关阈值或超参数。
4. 问题：在医学图像应用中，除了胸部 X 光图像，该方法是否适用于其他类型的医学图像（如 MRI、CT 等）？
- 解答：论文仅展示了在胸部 X 光图像上的应用效果。对于其他医学图像类型，由于其成像原理和图像特征与 X 光不同，需要进一步研究和验证。例如，MRI 图像具有多序列、多对比度的特点，CT 图像在密度分辨率上有优势，可能需要针对这些特点对扩散模型进行适应性调整，如调整模型结构以更好地处理 3D 数据（MRI 和 CT 通常是 3D 图像），或者重新设计典型性度量方法以适应不同的疾病特征和图像模式。
5. 问题：如何进一步提高扩散模型在数据挖掘任务中的效率，尤其是在处理超大规模数据集时？
- 解答：可以考虑采用分布式训练技术，将数据集分割到多个计算节点上并行训练，减少训练时间。同时，在模型架构方面，可以探索更轻量化的网络结构设计，在不损失太多性能的前提下减少模型参数和计算量。另外，优化数据预处理流程，减少不必要的计算和存储开销，也有助于提高整体效率。例如，采用更高效的图像编码方式和数据采样策略，使得模型在训练和推理过程中能够更快地处理数据。
以下是一些初学者可能会提出的重要问题及解答：
 
1. 问题：什么是扩散模型？它是如何工作的？
- 解答：扩散模型是一种生成模型，其训练过程是将随机噪声逐步转化为目标分布。在训练时，会先对训练样本添加不同强度的噪声，然后学习如何去噪以恢复原始图像。例如，在正向过程中按特定系数混合图像与高斯噪声，在测试时则通过迭代去噪从噪声分布中采样生成图像。它能够生成高质量的图像，并且可以基于输入信号（如文本等）进行条件生成，在建模复杂多模态分布方面表现出色。
2. 问题：如何理解典型性这个概念在数据挖掘中的作用？
- 解答：典型性用于衡量视觉元素对于特定类标签的代表性程度。如果扩散模型在有某个标签条件下对某视觉元素的去噪效果更好，那么该元素对于这个标签就是典型的。通过计算典型性分数，可以对图像中的元素进行排序，找出那些最能代表不同类别的元素，从而总结数据集的特征，比如在汽车数据集中找到不同年代汽车的典型部件，或在地理数据集中确定能代表不同国家的场景元素。
3. 问题：为什么要对扩散模型进行微调？微调的具体过程是怎样的？
- 解答：微调是为了让模型更好地适应特定的数据集，提高挖掘结果的质量。具体过程是使用数据集的标签（转换为 CLIP 文本特征）作为条件，基于重建损失优化模型。例如，对于街景数据，会将标签如 “A Google streetview image of {country}.” 转换为文本特征后用于微调。在微调过程中还可以采用如 xformers 优化和 LoRA 等技术，帮助模型更快收敛和更好地适应数据。
4. 问题：DIFT 特征是什么？它在聚类过程中起到什么作用？
- 解答：DIFT 特征是通过在扩散模型的反向过程中，在特定时间步（如 t = 0.161）提取的中间层激活得到的。在聚类时，先将具有较高典型性的图像块用 DIFT 特征进行嵌入，然后使用 k - means 算法对这些嵌入后的特征进行聚类。这样可以根据特征的相似性将图像块聚成不同的类，从而总结出数据集的典型视觉元素模式。
5. 问题：在应用部分，如何创建平行数据集并分析视觉元素的变化趋势？
- 解答：创建平行数据集时，使用如 Plug and Play 方法将一个位置的图像转换到其他位置，例如将 G^3 数据集中的图像从一个国家转换到其他国家，形成大量的转换后图像对。然后定义共典型性度量，通过计算不同位置转换后图像块的典型性中位数来衡量元素在不同位置的典型性变化。通过对这些数据的分析，可以发现如建筑元素（屋顶、窗户颜色和形状）、设施（电线杆、邮箱等）在不同国家的变化规律，从而总结出视觉元素的趋势。

## CONTENT

 By fine-tuning conditional diffusion models on specific datasets and defining a typicality measure, it can effectively mine visual patterns in datasets with different tags such as time, geography, and semantic labels.
The method overcomes the scalability issues faced by traditional visual data mining techniques. Unlike traditional methods that require pairwise comparisons of all visual elements in the dataset, this approach does not rely on such comparisons and can handle large and diverse datasets, including historical car datasets, face datasets, street-view datasets, and scene datasets.
The paper also explores two applications. One is to analyze the trends of visual elements across different locations by translating geographical elements and mining typical translations. The other is to apply the typicality measure to medical images and improve the localization of abnormal areas in X-ray images of patients with various thorax diseases.

can not deploy on big dataset.

Scalability: Traditional SVM-based visual data mining methods require pairwise comparisons of all visual elements in the dataset to locate nearest neighbors and establish clusters. This leads to a quadratic increase in computational complexity with the growth of the dataset size. In contrast, the method proposed in this paper does not rely on such pairwise comparisons. It uses a diffusion model-based analysis-by-synthesis approach, which can scale well to very large datasets. For example, it can handle datasets like G^3 with 344K images and Places with 1.8M images, while SVM methods would struggle with such large-scale data.

svm can only identify the most typical image region
 iconic elements like aviator glasses in the 1920s and military hats in the 1940s,
svm can not identify so exactly
Ability to Mine Typical Elements: SVM-based works mainly focus on discriminative tasks rather than actually mining typical visual elements in the dataset. This paper, however, is designed specifically to identify the most typical image regions. By defining a typicality measure based on the performance of the diffusion model in denoising images under different label conditions, it can effectively extract characteristic visual patterns. For instance, in the face dataset, it can discover iconic elements like aviator glasses in the 1920s and military hats in the 1940s, which SVM methods are not capable of.


# Refined Speech for Presentation

Hello everyone,

Thank you for joining me today. I’m excited to present  the paper, **"Diffusion Models as Data Mining Tools,"** published at ECCV 2024 spot. 
Let’s explore together.
---

To start, let me pose a question: What makes Prague look like Prague?
 When we think about the essence of a city, 
** certain elements stand out.** For Prague, these could be:

1. **The Clock Tower** – A symbol of the city’s **rich historical tapestry.**
2. **The Spires** – Towering and sacred, embodying European heritage.
3. **The Red Roofs** – since i come from asia, i find it very eye-catching just like what i think the fairy tale town is.

While humans intuitively identify these features, achieving this computationally is challenging. This paper addresses the challenge using **diffusion models** as tools for visual data mining.

---

#### Diffusion Models Overview

Diffusion models work through two main processes:

1. **Forward Process**: Incrementally adds noise to data.
2. **Backward Process**: Removes noise to reconstruct the data with a trained model.

This iterative approach helps extract meaningful patterns. The model discussed here, **Stable Diffusion**, introduces two key innovations:

1. **Conditional Diffusion**: Guides generation using prompts, such as text labels.
2. **Latent Diffusion**: Operates in a compressed latent space, improving efficiency.

---

#### Typicality in Visual Data Mining

The concept of "typicality" is central. A visual element is considered typical if the model denoises data more effectively with a label. For instance:

- Without the label “Prague,” the model struggles.
- With the label, the loss decreases, indicating the element’s relevance.

By calculating typicality scores, we can pinpoint the most characteristic features in a dataset.

---
Details of Mining
Conditioning and Fine - Tuning: In the first street - view data, the new conditioning changes from an empty stream to a Google street - view image. For fine - tuning, we train each model on the target dataset by optimizing the loss.
Clustering: We collect patches with high typicality, say 1000 out of 10,000 pictures. Then we embed these patches in DFT features, considering the time parameter. After getting the features, we run k - means on them. The DFT (Diffusion Features) for an image  involves adding noise at time step , feeding it to the diffusion model, and extracting intermediate - layer activations.
Datasets and Results
The paper uses four datasets: cars, faces, geometry, and places. The first two are small, and the latter two are large and newly used in this paper. The results show that for a label like "soccer field," we can distinguish typical and non - typical pictures. Fine - tuning also helps in highlighting more typical elements

#### Applications


**Styles of Different Countries**: Instead of fixing the label \(C\), we change it, for example, from a Japanese photo to a UK photo (\(C_1\)). We generate a new picture \(XC_1\) and calculate the typicality. By selecting 10 countries in the dataset, we can find trends. For instance, roof pictures often have high typicality, and roof colors can vary between countries.

**Medical Images**: The paper uses a dataset of 8000 medical images with 7 disease classes, marked with red rectangles indicating regions of interest. Our fine - tuned model shows good results in finding the ROI for tuberculosis. The pre - trained model doesn't perform as well as the fine - tuned one.

---

#### Limitations

1. **Clustering Challenges**: Unrelated elements, like eyes and mouths, may cluster together.
2. **Noise Artifacts**: Noise introduced during feature extraction can reduce accuracy.
3. **Limited Generalization**: Fine-tuned models may overfit specific datasets.

---

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, **diffusion models** are powerful tools for visual data mining, uncovering patterns in cultural and medical contexts. They bridge generative AI with practical applications, offering a glimpse into future innovations.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your feedback and any questions you might have!

# GPT4 paper assistant: A daily ArXiv scanner

This repo implements a very simple daily scanner for Arxiv that uses GPT4 and author matches to find papers you might find interesting. 
It will run daily via github actions and can post this information to slack via a bot or just render it in a static github-pages website.

A simple demo of the daily papers can be seen [here](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/gpt_paper_assistant/) running on `cs.CL`

As a cost estimate, running this on all of `cs.CL` cost $0.07 on 2/7/2024

## Changelog
- **2/15/2024**: fixed a bug with author parsing in the RSS format + cost estimates for title filtering being off + crash when 0 papers are on the feed. 
- **2/7/2024**: fixed a critical issue from ArXiv changing their RSS format. Added and enabled a title filtering to reduce costs.


## Quickstart
This is the minimal necessary steps to get the scanner to run. It is highly recommended to read the whole thing to decide what you want to run.

### Running on github actions

1. Copy/fork this repo to a new github repo and [enable scheduled workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow) if you fork it.
2. Copy `config/paper_topics.template.txt` to `config/paper_topics.txt` and fill it out with the types of papers you want to follow
3. Copy `config/authors.template.txt` to `config/authors.txt` and list the authors you actually want to follow. The numbers behind the author are important. They are semantic scholar author IDs which you can find by looking up the authors on semantic scholar and taking the numbers at the end of the URL.
4. Set your desired ArXiv categories in `config/config.ini`.
5. Set your openai key (`OAI_KEY`) as ``a [github secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)
6. In your repo settings, set github page build sources to be [github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow)

At this point your bot should run daily and publish a static website. You can test this by running the github action workflow manually.

**Optional but highly recommended**: 

7. Get and set up a semantic scholar API key (`S2_KEY`) as a github secret. Otherwise the author search step will be very slow
8. [Set up a slack bot](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart), get the OAuth key, set it to `SLACK_KEY` as a github secret
9. Make a channel for the bot (and invite it to the channel), get its [Slack channel id](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40940327/what-is-the-simplest-way-to-find-a-slack-team-id-and-a-channel-id), set it as `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` in a github secret.
10. Take a look at `configs/config.ini` to tweak how things are filtered.
11. Set the github repo private to avoid github actions being [set to inactive after 60 days](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow)

Each day at 1pm UTC, the bot will run and post to slack and publish a github pages website (see the publish_md and cron_runs actions for details).

### Running locally

The steps are generally the same as above, but you have to set up the environment via `requirements.txt`

Instead of passing credentials via github secrets, you have to set environment variables `OAI_KEY`, `SLACK_KEY`, `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`.

To run everything, just call `main.py`

**Other notes:**
You may also want to not push to slack, in which case set your desired output endpoint (json, markdown, slack) in the `dump_json`, `dump_md`, and `push_to_slack` fields of `config/config.ini`.

If the semantic scholar API times out or is slow, you should get a [S2 api key](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key-form) and set it as `S2_KEY` in your environment variables.
(due to the limitations of github actions, this will only help if the code is run locally)

**Making it run on its own:**
This whole thing takes almost no compute, so you can rent the cheapest VM from AWS, put this repo in it, install the `requirements.txt`
appropriately set up the environment variables and add the following crontab
```
0 13 * * * python ~/arxiv_scanner/main.py
```
This crontab will run the script every 1pm UTC, 6pm pacific. 

## Making the `paper_topics.txt` prompt
The `paper_topics.txt` file is used to generate the prompt for GPT. It is a list of topics that you want to follow.
One set of examples might be something like 
```text
 1. New methodological improvements to RLHF or instruction-following which are specific fine-tuning steps that are taken to make language models better at following user instructions across a range of tasks.
    - Relevant: papers that discuss specific methods like RLHF, or instruction-tuning datasets, improving these methods, or analyzing them.
    - Not relevant: papers about adaptation to some task. Simply following instructions or inputs are not sufficient.
 2. Shows new powerful test set contamination or membership inference methods for language models. Test set contamination is the phenomenon where a language model observes a benchmark dataset during pretraining.
    - Relevant: test statistics that can detect contamination of benchmarks in language models. statistics that can provide guarantees are more interesting. membership inference methods that are general enough to apply to language models are also relevant.
    - Not relevant: any papers that do not consider language models, or that do not consider test set contamination.
 3. Shows a significant advance in the performance of diffusion language models.
    - Relevant: papers that study language models that are also diffusion models. Continuous diffusions are even more relevant, while discrete diffusions are less so.
    - Not relevant: papers about image diffusions like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion, or papers that do not explicitly mention language models or applications to text.
```
This is just a standard prompt, but being very specific can help, especially for things like 'diffusion language models' or 'instruction-following', where the LM can get confused about whether image diffusions are relevant, or if doing some task better is sufficient to improve instruction following.

You may also want to follow this with some general interest areas like
```text
In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on statistical machine learning, and generative modeling in natural language processing.
 Your friend also likes learning about surprising empirical results in language models, as well as clever statistical tricks.
 He does not want to read papers that are about primarily applications of methods to specific domains.
```

## Details of how it works

The script grabs a candidate set of ArXiv papers for a specific day, via the RSS feeds. To avoid double-announcing papers, it will only grab an RSS feed within the last day. To avoid missing papers, you'd want to run this every day. 
It filters out any `UPDATED` papers and announces only new ones.

The filtering logic is pretty simple. We first check for author match.
1. Do a lookup of the authors on semantic scholar, getting a list of candidate matches.
2. Check the authors of the paper. If the author semantic scholar id matches someone in `authors.txt` it goes in the candidate set with a default score of `author_match_score`.

We then check for GPT-evaluated relevance. We do this in two steps.
1. Filter out any papers that have no authors with h-index above `hcutoff` in `config.ini`. This is to reduce costs.
2. All remaining examples get batched, and are evaluated by a GPT model specified by `model` in `config.ini`. **You should only use GPT3.5 for debugging. It does not work well for this purpose!**
This step uses the following prompt setup defined in `configs/`

>You are a helpful paper reading assistant whose job is to read daily posts from ArXiv and identify a few papers that might be relevant for your friend. There will be up to 5 papers below. Your job is to find papers that:
> 1. Criterion 1
> 2. Criterion 2
> 
> [PAPERS]
> 
> Write the response in JSONL format with {ARXIVID, COMMENT, RELEVANCE, NOVELTY} on each line, one for each paper.
The ARXIVID should be the ArXiv ID.
The COMMENT should identify whether there is a criteria that match the paper very closely. If so, it should mention it by number (no need to mention the non-matching criteria).
These matches should not be based on general terms like "language modeling" or "advancements" and should specifically refer to a criterion.
The RELEVANCE should be a relevance score from 1-10 where 10 must be directly related to the exact, specific criterion with near-synonym keyword matches and authors who are known for working on the topic, 1 is irrelevant to any criterion, and unrelated to your friend's general interest area, 2-3 is papers that are relevant to the general interest area, but not specific criteria, and 5 is a direct match to a specific criterion.
The NOVELTY should be a score from 1 to 10, where 10 is a groundbreaking, general-purpose discovery that would transform the entire field and 1 is work that improves one aspect of a problem or is an application to a very specific field. Read the abstract carefully to determine this and assume that authors cannot be trusted in their claims of novelty.

3. GPT scores the papers for relevance (to the topics in `config/papers_topics.txt`) and novelty (scale 1-10)
4. Papers are filtered if they have scores below either the relevance and novelty cutoffs in `config.ini`
5. Papers are given an overall score based on equal weight to relevance and novelty

Finally, all papers are sorted by the max of their `author_match_score` and the sum of the GPT-rated relevance and novelty scores (the relevance and novelty scores will only show up in the final output if they are above the cutoff thresholds you set in the config file). Then the papers are rendered and pushed into their endpoints (text files or Slack).

Please install the pre-commit hook by running `pre-commit install`

### Testing and improving the GPT filter
The `filter_papers.py` code can also be run as a standalone script.
This will take a batch of papers in `in/debug_papers.json`, run whatever config and prompts you have
and return an output to `out/filter_paper_test.debug.json`. If you find the bot makes mistakes, you can find the associated batch in `out/gpt_paper_batches.debug.json` and copy that into the relevant `debug_papers` file.

This lets you build a benchmark for the filter and to see what comes out on the other side.
